How to Contribute
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First, fork the repository for development.  It is probably a good idea to communicate your intentions with the other developers via the developer message boards.  After thoroughly testing you can submit a pull request.  This request must include verification code and fuly updated documentation.  Accepted contributions will be included in the master (so as to be immediately available for all developers) and will be included in the following distributed releases.
