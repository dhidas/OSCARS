Welcome to the OSCARS documentation!
====================================

OSCARS is a generalized tool for calculating the radiative properties of charged particles in electromagnetic fields.

This software package supports
------------------------------

   * Fully relativistic trajectory calculations in 3D
   * Calculation of Spectra
   * Power density calculations on arbitrary shaped surfaces in 3D
   * Flux density calculations
   * Multi-particle simulations
   * Non-zero emittance beams
   * Mixed-particle beams
   * Importing of field data in several formats
   * Users who are interested in contributing to further development

This software package provides
------------------------------

   * A user interface in python
   * Multi-threaded operation
   * Simple utilities for GPU computing
   * Support for grid computing
   * Support for MPI
