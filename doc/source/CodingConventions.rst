Coding Conventions
==================

An attempt has been made to adhere to some reasonable standards for development of core code, with very few exceptions.

Python
------

For python coding conventions the Python Enhancement Proposals (PEP) 8 has been used.

C++
---

For code written in C++, the conventions are largely based off of the CERN's ROOT coding conventions.  One of the exceptions is the use of native types, which this code uses extensively.  The assumption is that your machine does not use a 32-bit 'double'
