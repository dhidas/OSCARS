    "# Power Density - All About\n",
    "\n",
    "This document gives some of the details about power density calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the moment the power density calculations require points in space and the surface normal vector at each point.  There are some utilities to easily create rectangular surfaces (made up of such point and normal vectors) and some parametric surfaces.  It is also possible to calculate the power density at arbitrary points in space.  These arbitrary points in space are difficult to connect as a surface for visualization by most plotting software (typically they must be on some mesh), nevertheless the calculation is possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the builtin surface types there are simple ways to rotate and translate them in space, typically by giving the power density calculation function the arguments 'rotations=[rx, ry, rz]' and 'translation=[tx, ty, tz]'.  Rotations are done before translation and in the order of rx (rotation about x-axis), ry, rz ad are given in radian.  The translation is done after and given in meters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any of these can be run in multi-threaded, GPU, or MPI mode.  Results from running on separate nodes on grid/cloud computing can be combined.\n"
