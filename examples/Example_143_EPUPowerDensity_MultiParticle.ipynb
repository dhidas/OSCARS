You can define the initial position and time of a particle beam to be anywhere you like.  The default initial time for a beam is t=0.  You must specify the initial position, which for this simple example it is recommended to be *before* the undulator (in the plot at z=-1 [m] is a good choice if the particle beam is defined to be going in the +z direction as is done below.\n",

In this example we will start the calculation at t=0 and go to t=2 (given in units of ct) since the beam is relativistic.  In this example you can specify the start time as less than 0 which is useful if you want to propogate the particle backwars in time.  This is useful for instance if you have a bending magnet before the undulator that you wish to include.\n",
