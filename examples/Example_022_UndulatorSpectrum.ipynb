The *period* is also in vector form which allows you to orient the axis of the undulator in any arbitrary direction.  The number of periods is given by *nperiods*.  This is the number of FULL periods.  A terminating field of 1 period length is added to each side in addition to *nperiods*.  Typically clear_magnetic_fields() is called before adding a field in notebooks only to save time when making changes and rerunning sections of the code so it is not strictly necessary."

You can define the initial position and time of a particle beam to be anywhere you like.  The default initial time for a beam is t=0.  You must specify the initial position, which for this simple example it is recommended to be *before* the undulator (in the plot at z=-1 [m] is a good choice if the particle beam is defined to be going in the +z direction as is done below.\n",

In this example we will start the calculation at t=0 and go to t=2 (given in units of ct) since the beam is relativistic.  In this example you can specify the start time as less than 0 which is useful if you want to propogate the particle backwars in time.  This is useful for instance if you have a bending magnet before the undulator that you wish to include.\n",
