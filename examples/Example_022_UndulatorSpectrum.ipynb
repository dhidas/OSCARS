The *period* is also in vector form which allows you to orient the axis of the undulator in any arbitrary direction.  The number of periods is given by *nperiods*.  This is the number of FULL periods.  A terminating field of 1 period length is added to each side in addition to *nperiods*.  Typically clear_magnetic_fields() is called before adding a field in notebooks only to save time when making changes and rerunning sections of the code so it is not strictly necessary."
